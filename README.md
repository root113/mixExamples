# mixExamples
Here are some exmples for C and C++ I have made in lecture.
Mostly all of the files are my production.
But there are a few which are the product of a team work.

I have created this repository to help beginners.
You can see same examples of C and C++ so you might get familiar with the language.
These are all basic levels.
