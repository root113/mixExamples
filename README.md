Here are some exmples for C I have made in lecture.

Some of these codes are my production. Rest were done with lecturer.

But there are a few which are the product of a team work.

I have created this repository to help beginners.

You can see same examples of C programming so you might get familiar with the language.

These are all basic levels.
